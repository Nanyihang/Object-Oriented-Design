Notes:
======
1. No payload specific processing in Query
   - due to use of template member select(T t)
2. No payload specific processing in Persist
   - due to requirement on PayLoad classes to implement
     - toXmlElement
     - fromXmlElement
   Persist just uses those
3. Solution structure is not optimal for deployment
   - we need a static library for all of NoSql
     - no problem, Executive package can help with that
   - now we need directories holding each header
     - fixing requires moving .h files out of project folders
4. Moved all application-wide definitions into Definitions.h
5. TestClass provides a lot of documentation about how to use
   the NoSql database
   - especially useful because the documentation is executable
